I am a boy
I am good.
How are you?
My name is John.
What is your name?
What does John like to eat tonight
Does the sun rise in the east?
I wonder why the sun rises in the east.
I am curious why Mary came this morning.
Is it true that the Internet is really bad
Do you like football.
Does she like football?
